# Chatbot with Flask and TensorFlow/Keras

This is a simple chatbot application built using Flask for the backend and TensorFlow/Keras for the chatbot model. Users can interact with the chatbot through a web interface where they can input messages, and the chatbot will respond with appropriate answers based on the trained model.

## Project Structure

- `.idea/`: Directory containing IDE settings (if using an IDE like PyCharm).
- `Flask/`: Directory containing the Flask application files.
- `data/`: Directory containing data files used for training the chatbot.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for the web interface.
- `chatbot.py`: Python script containing the chatbot functionality.
- `chatbot_model.h5`: Pre-trained chatbot model saved in HDF5 format.
- `tag_list.pkl`: Preprocessed classes data saved as a pickle file.
- `word_list.pkl`: Preprocessed words data saved as a pickle file.
- `training.py`: Script for training the chatbot model.
- `README.md`: Documentation file (this file).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download NLTK resources required for text processing:

   ```
   python -m nltk.downloader punkt
   python -m nltk.downloader wordnet
   ```

4. Train the chatbot model using TensorFlow/Keras by running the `training.py` script or use your own pre-trained model.

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server by running the following command:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Input your messages in the provided form and submit them to interact with the chatbot.

## More Information



**What is this?**

This is a chatbot program that you can interact with using text messages. It's like talking to a robot that understands what you're saying and tries to respond appropriately.

**How does it work?**

1. **Understanding**: When you type a message, the chatbot tries to understand what you're asking or saying. It does this by breaking down your message into individual words and figuring out the main topic or intent behind it. For example, if you ask about the weather, it knows you're probably asking about the weather.

2. **Thinking**: Once it understands your message, the chatbot "thinks" about what it should say in response. It looks through its memory to find the best answer based on what it knows. It might have different answers stored away for different types of questions or topics.

3. **Responding**: After thinking for a moment, the chatbot replies with what it thinks is the most appropriate response. It might say something informative, helpful, or just try to keep the conversation going.

**How do I use it?**

1. **Start Chatting**: To begin, just type a message and hit enter. The chatbot will respond based on what you said.

2. **Keep Talking**: You can keep chatting with the bot by typing more messages. It will try its best to understand you and keep the conversation going.


**Why was it made?**

This chatbot was created to demonstrate how computers can understand and respond to human language. It's a fun project to show how artificial intelligence can be used to interact with people in a conversational way.

**Who made it?**

This chatbot was made by Nitin Joshi as a personal project. It's not perfect, but it's a good starting point for learning about natural language processing and chatbot development.

**Have fun chatting!**
